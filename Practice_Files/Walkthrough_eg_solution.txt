7. a variable i of type integer is being declared
8. a variable total_salary of type float is being declared and instantiated to 0
9. an array Faculty of structure type with size 3 is being declared
10. A message is printed to enter the details for 3 faculties
11. for loop is entered, i is set to 0, 0 < 3? true - proceed to first line in loop
12. A message is printed to enter ID of the faculty
13. Accept the input from the user in Faculty[0].facultyId
14. A message is printed to enter salary of the faculty
15. Accept the input from the user in Faculty[0].salary
11. i incremented by 1, i equals 1, 1 < 3? true - proceed to first line in loop
12. A message is printed to enter ID of the faculty
13. Accept the input from the user in Faculty[1].facultyId
14. A message is printed to enter salary of the faculty
15. Accept the input from the user in Faculty[1].salary
11. i incremented by 1, i equals 2, 2 < 3? true - proceed to first line in loop
12. A message is printed to enter ID of the faculty
13. Accept the input from the user in Faculty[2].facultyId
14. A message is printed to enter salary of the faculty
15. Accept the input from the user in Faculty[2].salary
11. i incremented by 1, i equals 3, 3 < 3? False – exit for loop
18. A message is printed to display the details being entered
19. for loop is entered, i is set to 0, 0 < 3? true - proceed to first line in loop 
20. total_salary = 0+faculty[0].salary
19. i incremented by 1, i equals 1, 1 < 3? true - proceed to first line in loop
20. total_salary = total_salary+faculty[1].salary
19. i incremented by 2, i equals 2, 2 < 3? true - proceed to first line in loop
20. total salary = total_salary +faculty[2].salary
19. i incremented by 1, i equals 3, 3 < 3? False, exits the loop
23. returns the control to the operating system and exits with the value 0
